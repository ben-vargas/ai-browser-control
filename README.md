# Browser Control

Browser Control lets trusted coding agents run Playwright against your existing
Chromium-family browser. It uses your real browser profile, including logged-in
sessions and installed extensions, instead of launching a separate headless
browser.

```text
Agent or CLI -> local relay -> browser extension -> your browser
```

The driver runs locally and does not contain an LLM or make planning decisions.
Its primary interface is code: an agent sends a Playwright snippet and receives
the result, logs, warnings, and a summary of what changed.

## Quick Start

Browser Control requires Node.js 22.19 or newer and a Chromium-family browser such
as Chrome, Brave, Edge, Arc, or Chromium.

Setup has three parts: install the npm package, install the agent skill, and
load the included browser extension. Add MCP only when your agent prefers MCP
tools over shell commands.

### 1. Install the CLI

```bash
npm install --global @opencode-ai/browser-control
```

This installs two commands:

- `browser-control` for CLI and skill-driven agents
- `browser-control-mcp` for MCP clients

### 2. Connect your agent

The packaged skill teaches coding agents how to inspect before acting, preserve
session identity, handle human-only steps, and recover from browser failures.
Install it with the [skills CLI](https://skills.sh):

```bash
npx skills add anomalyco/browser-control --skill browser-control -g
```

Choose the agents you use when prompted. The global `-g` installation makes the
skill available across projects.

Browser Control does not edit agent configuration itself. To inspect or install
the skill manually, print the exact bundled text:

```bash
browser-control skill
```

#### Optional MCP server

The skill and MCP server do different jobs. The skill teaches the workflow; MCP
exposes Browser Control as tools. Agents that can run shell commands need only
the skill. Add MCP when your client prefers MCP tools.

For OpenCode:

```jsonc
// opencode.json
{
  "mcp": {
    "browser-control": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["browser-control-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

For Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add browser-control -- browser-control-mcp
```

CLI and MCP clients share the detached relay, but each execute session keeps its
own default page and persistent JavaScript `state`. Restarting an MCP process
does not stop the relay or interrupt an active CLI session.

MCP initialization, tool discovery, `skill`, and `session_current` do not contact
or start the relay. The first operational call (such as `execute`, `session_new`,
or `session_adopt`) starts it if needed. Relay-backed observational tools report
an unavailable relay rather than starting one.

### 3. Load the extension

Browser Control currently ships its extension as an unpacked extension inside
the npm package.

1. Print the extension directory:

   ```bash
   printf '%s\n' "$(npm root --global)/@opencode-ai/browser-control/extension/dist"
   ```

2. Open `chrome://extensions` or your browser's equivalent, such as
   `brave://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Select **Load unpacked** and choose the printed directory.
5. Pin the Browser Control toolbar button.

### 4. Run your first browser command

Ask the configured agent to use Browser Control, or verify the installation
directly:

```bash
browser-control execute 'await page.goto("https://example.com"); return { title: await page.title(), url: page.url() }'
```

The command starts a detached local relay when needed, opens a browser tab, and
prints a readable session ID with the exact `--session` command needed to
continue. The relay listens on `127.0.0.1:19989` and stays running between CLI
calls.

A successful run returns the `Example Domain` title, a generated session ID,
and a continuation command. `browser-control status` then reports the extension
as connected.

Check the installation at any time with:

```bash
browser-control doctor
browser-control status
```

`doctor` and `status` are read-only. They report a stopped relay but never start
one. Use `browser-control serve` only for foreground debugging.

## TypeScript Client

The package also exports an Effect client for applications that need structured
browser-authenticated requests without executing generated JavaScript:

```ts
import { BrowserControlClient } from "@opencode-ai/browser-control"
import { Effect, Schema } from "effect"

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const client = yield* BrowserControlClient.make()
  const browserSession = yield* client.ensureSession({ id: "my-app" })
  const account = yield* browserSession.authenticatedOrigin({
    origin: "https://app.example.com",
    startUrl: "/account",
  })

  const sensitive = yield* account.json({
    path: "/api/session",
    method: "POST",
    body: {},
    response: Schema.Struct({ accessToken: Schema.String }),
    sensitive: true,
  })
  const credentials = BrowserControlClient.reveal(sensitive)

  const profile = yield* account.json({
    path: "/api/profile",
    response: Schema.Struct({ name: Schema.String }),
  })
  return { credentials, profile }
})
```

Requests use `window.fetch` in the session's current page, so ambient browser
cookies stay in the browser. Paths must be same-origin, redirects are blocked,
responses are bounded, and mutations are never retried automatically. Set
`sensitive: true` to receive `Redacted<A>`; sensitive requests bypass execute
journals and are rejected while session network capture is active. Reveal a
sensitive result with `BrowserControlClient.reveal`; this keeps unwrapping in
the same Effect runtime that created the redacted value, including when an
application and Browser Control resolve separate Effect package instances.
Client construction waits through a bounded extension reconnect window even
when the matching relay was already running. A session summary reports
`connected: true` only when its Playwright transport and live default page are
both available.
Use `resetSession(id)` to replace a persisted session generation that is no
longer connected before creating a new authenticated-origin capability.

Applications with a generated direct client can also consume a Secret Profile
without requiring users to wrap the application in `browser-control secrets
run`:

```ts
import { SecretProfile } from "@opencode-ai/browser-control"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const result = await Effect.runPromise(SecretProfile.run({
  name: "github",
  command: process.execPath,
  args: ["./github-cli.js", "repositories"],
}))

process.stdout.write(result.stdout)
process.stderr.write(result.stderr)
process.exitCode = result.exitCode
```

The trusted child receives `BC_SECRET_N` variables. The parent never receives
their raw values, and known values are redacted from bounded child output. `status()`
returns metadata only; the public SDK intentionally does not expose raw profile
reads.

## Work in Sessions

A bare `execute` creates a fresh session. Pass its ID to continue with the same
page and `state`:

```bash
browser-control session new docs
browser-control execute --session docs 'await page.goto("https://example.com/docs"); state.visits = (state.visits ?? 0) + 1; return state.visits'
browser-control execute --session docs 'return { url: page.url(), visits: state.visits }'
browser-control journal --session docs
```

The journal is a best-effort local activity record stored under
`~/.browser-control/sessions/<id>/journal.jsonl`. It includes bounded script and
result previews and remains after session deletion. Do not embed passwords,
tokens, or other credentials directly in execute code.

Single expressions return automatically, so this shorter form also works:

```bash
browser-control execute --session docs 'await page.title()'
```

Use `--file script.js` for longer programs and `--json` for a machine-readable
result envelope. Delete the session when you finish:

```bash
browser-control session delete docs
```

Deletion is idempotent for an explicit session id, so cleanup can be safely
retried when that session is already absent.

## Control an Existing Tab

Relay-created pages are isolated from other Browser Control sessions. To use a
tab that is already logged in:

1. Open the tab in your browser.
2. Click the Browser Control toolbar button to attach it.
3. Adopt it into a session using a unique URL substring:

```bash
browser-control session new github
browser-control session adopt --session github --target-url github.com
browser-control execute --session github 'return { title: await page.title(), url: page.url() }'
```

Adoption is exclusive to one Browser Control session. Resetting or deleting the
session releases an adopted user tab without closing it.

## Inspect Before Acting

Execute code receives normal Playwright `browser`, `context`, and `page`
objects, plus Browser Control helpers. `snapshot()` is the compact default for
reading a page before interaction:

```bash
browser-control execute --session github 'return await snapshot()'
```

Snapshot controls include refs such as `[ref=e12]`. Use a ref in the next call:

```bash
browser-control execute --session github 'await ref("e12").click(); return await snapshot({ diff: true })'
```

Refs belong to the latest snapshot and become stale after navigation. They
combine structural and accessible identity so DOM drift fails closed instead
of silently targeting a different control.

Other inspection helpers include:

- `ariaSnapshot()` for a deeper accessibility-tree view with native text-control
  values, custom ARIA range values, and editable content omitted; await it
  separately from other operations on the same page
- `screenshotWithLabels()` for an annotated screenshot and element metadata
- `screenshotDiff({ baseline })` for changed-pixel metrics and a red-highlighted
  PNG against a saved baseline; capture both at the same CSS viewport scale
- `fillInput()` and `fillInputs()` when browser extensions interfere with
  Playwright's normal `locator.fill()`

The agent skill gives the operating workflow and canonical examples; command
`--help` output remains the source of truth for detailed options.

## Pause for Human-Only Steps

Use `handoff()` for CAPTCHA, 2FA, payment confirmation, or another step that a
person must complete:

```js
await handoff("Complete 2FA, then use the in-page continue control")
await page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Dashboard" }).waitFor()
return page.url()
```

If the click itself can block on native WebAuthn or payment UI, register the
handoff before triggering it:

```js
await handoff("Complete the security-key prompt, then continue", {
  timeoutMs: 600_000,
  start: () => page.getByRole("button", { name: "Use security key" }).click({ timeout: 600_000 }),
})
```

The page displays an accessible completion control and the script waits. Always
verify the expected URL or element after the handoff; human acknowledgment does
not prove that the requested step succeeded. Browser Control waits for the
extension to acknowledge WAIT before calling `start`. If the handoff times out
or its target disappears first, it disconnects that sandbox's Playwright
connection before releasing the execute permit, preventing a still-pending
prompt action from mutating the page later. Keep `start` limited to the bounded
browser action that opens the native prompt.

## Use Read-Only Sessions

Read-only sessions reject mouse and keyboard CDP commands while allowing
navigation, inspection, and screenshots:

```bash
browser-control session new inspect --read-only
browser-control execute --session inspect 'await page.goto("https://example.com"); return await snapshot()'
```

Read-only mode prevents accidental Playwright input. It is not a security
sandbox: trusted code can still mutate a page with `page.evaluate()`.

## Record a Session

```bash
browser-control recording start ./demo.webm --session github
browser-control recording status --session github
browser-control recording stop --session github
```

Recording start/stop/status support `--json`. CDP quality receipts distinguish
output fps from received/retained source frames and report coalescing, drops,
dimensions, and screenshot fallback. These counters do not prove distinct motion.
Explicit frame rates must be integers from 1 to 60; unsupported values are rejected.

Visual comparison stays code-first:

```ts
await page.screenshot({ path: "/absolute/before.png", scale: "css" })
// Make the intended UI change, keeping the viewport unchanged.
return await screenshotDiff({ baseline: "/absolute/before.png" })
```

The result includes a diff image, `matches`, `changedPixels`, and `changedRatio`.
Use `path` for a new absolute PNG output instead of inline media. `threshold`
(default 0.1) controls pixel color tolerance, not allowed changed area. Different
dimensions fail without resizing. Images are bounded to 32 MiB / 16 megapixels;
existing output files are never overwritten. Review visible private content
before sharing either screenshots or diffs.

Automatic mode uses browser tab capture for user-owned tabs and CDP screencast
for relay-created tabs. Tab capture writes WebM and can include audio. CDP mode
writes WebM or MP4, requires `ffmpeg` on `PATH`, and does not capture audio.

## Derive a Direct Client

Capture authenticated API exchanges across as many execute calls or human
handoffs as the workflow needs:

```bash
browser-control network start --session github --url /api/ \
  --resource-type fetch --resource-type xhr
browser-control execute --session github --file ./perform-flow.js
browser-control network stop --session github \
  --output ./github.har --secrets github
```

Browser Control records normalized request/response exchanges itself; HAR is an
interoperable export, not the internal capture model. Written artifacts replace
cookies, authorization headers, CSRF tokens, API keys, and token-like query or
body fields with stable `${BC_SECRET_N}` references. Lossless values are stored
separately in a mode-`0600` profile under `~/.browser-control/secrets`.
Bodies that cannot be reliably redacted, including binary and file-bearing
multipart content, are omitted and reported as truncated.
Unknown-length and compressed response bodies are also omitted so Browser
Control never materializes them before it can enforce the configured budget.

Generated clients read the referenced environment variables and run without
printing or embedding the values:

```bash
browser-control secrets status github
browser-control secrets run github -- ./github-cli repositories
browser-control secrets refresh github --session github
```

`secrets refresh` reloads the session page and preserves references while
updating values observed at the same source. If reauthentication requires a
human flow, log in through the browser and repeat the capture with the same
profile name instead. Child stdout and stderr are redacted before Browser
Control returns them.

## Safety Boundaries

Browser Control trusts the local agent code it executes. It is a driver, not an
untrusted-code sandbox.

The extension requires broad browser permissions, including `debugger`,
`tabCapture`, and a status content script on all URLs. Attaching a user tab gives
Browser Control access to that tab through your existing browser profile.

The relay blocks destructive browser-wide CDP commands that clear cookies,
clear cache, or close the browser. It also keeps session-owned tabs private from
other Browser Control sessions. These guardrails reduce accidents, but scripts
still have access to the selected page, its logged-in state, and a limited set
of Node.js filesystem and network APIs.

Current limitations:

- The extension is installed unpacked; Chrome Web Store distribution is not
  available yet. The repository can produce the review artifact with
  `pnpm package:extension`; the first Store release will begin as an unlisted
  beta.
- Playwright download artifacts are unavailable because Chromium blocks the
  required download commands through `chrome.debugger`. Fetch exposed response
  bytes and write them with the provided `fs` module instead.
- CDP recording requires `ffmpeg`, activates the recorded tab, and has no audio.
- Browser Control is intended for trusted local use. It does not provide an
  authenticated remote relay.

## Troubleshooting and Upgrades

- **`browser-control: command not found`**: confirm npm's global binary
  directory is on `PATH`, then rerun the global install.
- **Extension disconnected**: confirm the unpacked extension is enabled, then
  reload it from the browser's extensions page. The extension reconnects to a
  running relay automatically.
- **After an npm upgrade**: reload the unpacked extension. Extension and relay
  versions may differ when they use the same reported protocol version.
- **Stale relay warning**: ordinary commands never replace a running relay.
  Coordinate with other users, finish recordings and raw CDP work, then run
  `browser-control relay restart`. It drains accepted work and preserves tabs
  and durable session identity, but JavaScript state and snapshot refs reset.
  A busy/timeout result leaves the relay running. Legacy relays without safe
  shutdown protocol 2 need a one-time coordinated manual stop; the new CLI will
  not force-kill them or downgrade a newer relay.
- **Who restarted the relay?** Inspect the private
  `~/.browser-control/relays/<port>/lifecycle.jsonl` records for requester, build,
  instance, and outcome metadata. Browser URLs and executed code are not recorded
  there.
For PowerShell, print the unpacked extension path with:

```powershell
Join-Path (npm root --global) "@opencode-ai/browser-control/extension/dist"
```

## Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:anomalyco/browser-control.git
cd browser-control
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm check:unused
pnpm check:locals
pnpm audit:duplicates

# Fresh paths outside this checkout; parent directories must exist.
mkdir -p "$HOME/.browser-control/builds" "$HOME/.browser-control/runtimes"
pnpm runtime:prepare \
  --staging "$HOME/.browser-control/builds/candidate-1" \
  --install "$HOME/.browser-control/runtimes/candidate-1"

# Select only after validation. This does not restart the relay.
pnpm runtime:select \
  --install "$HOME/.browser-control/runtimes/candidate-1" \
  --active "$HOME/.browser-control/active"
export PATH="$HOME/.browser-control/active/bin:$PATH"
```

For occasional whole-codebase audits, `pnpm exec knip --production` excludes test
usage. Review its findings rather than requiring a clean result: an export used
only by tests can still have production callers inside its own module. Normal
`pnpm check:unused` remains the CI gate.

Use the same `active/bin/browser-control-mcp` path in MCP configuration. Do not
`bun link` the active tool into the checkout: changing dependencies or rebuilding
`dist` would also change what other agents execute. Retain previous installation
directories while existing processes may still load resources from them. Selecting
an older installation does not authorize a daemon downgrade.

`pnpm runtime:check-lifecycle --previous /absolute/install-a --candidate
/absolute/install-b` checks two validated protocol-2 installations on a private
temporary home and loopback port using a fake extension. The candidate must have
a later build id. It verifies non-replacement by ordinary CLI/MCP clients,
explicit restart attribution, synthetic adopted-target restoration, and downgrade
refusal. It does not prove real-browser tab continuity or cross-release
compatibility when both installations came from the same source revision.

For a build-only check, `pnpm build:cli --outdir /absolute/fresh-external-directory`
redirects bundles and declarations together. Candidate preparation never writes
checkout `dist`, `node_modules`, or the loaded `extension/dist`. Explicitly run
`browser-control relay restart` when ready to replace the active daemon.

Extension source changes require `pnpm build:extension` and reloading the
unpacked extension. Relay-only changes require rebuilding or restarting the
relay, not reloading the extension.
